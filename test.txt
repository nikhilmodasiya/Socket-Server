Run Server by command
python server.py

Implementation of Server:-
 Basicallly i have created a socket which is  bind with localhost:8888.Initially Server is waiting for client connection.When server gets any connection request, it accept it & take the header of the client request. By parsing the header, server decide whether client request is PUT request or GET request. After deciding it takes accordingly action . If client request want to make some new connection with some connection-Id & timeout my server allocate them a new process for the given time.After completion of time, server respond them & process get terminated by server.
 For tracking the current status of server i have created time_status dictionary which is share among all process,which is updated every second.I have also created socket_status & process_status dictionary which is useful when we want to kill any process or close any connection 

 I have tested my server using curl.  

Followig are my testing result :
test 1. curl 'http://localhost:8888/api/request?connId=19&timeout=80'
   Output:-After 80 second {"status":"OK"}

test 2. curl 'http://localhost:8888/api/request?connId=9&timeout=70'
   Output:-After 70 second {"status":"OK"}

test 3. curl http://localhost:8888/api/serverStatus
   Output:-{'19':'30','9':'41',}

test 4. curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X PUT -d '{"connId":9}' http://localhost:8888/api/kill
   Output:-{invaild connection Id :9}

test 5. curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X PUT -d '{"connId":19}' http://
   localhost:8888/api/kill
   Output:-{"status":"kill"}
